# Co-creative community knowledge group 1

This project aims to let the communities share their information, and this project uses SpringJPA to access the MySQL database. However, we built our database using University's MySQL Server, and there is some restriction on running outside of the University's network. Therefore, the application might not run property outside of University's network.

  	created a dynamic view-case-study page(Both Frontend and Backend)
